faqs:
  - question: Can I get a refund if I'm unhappy with this bundle?
    answer: In the absolutely remote chance that you are - just email me and you'll have your money back.
  - question: Is this the same as a lifetime membership?
    answer: You get the included courses for life, that's for sure. It's just that this bundle doesn't contain any future courses, unlike the monthly/yearly membership.
  - question: What about updates?
    answer: All the included courses come with free updates, so you'll get all of them for free.
  - question: (fake bragging question) Just how much content am I looking at?
    answer: 320+ hours of content, 60000 lines of code from scratch, hundreds of lessons and hundreds of live examples and exercises. Plus takeaway slides.
  - question: Does this include access to the private Rock the JVM community?
    answer: You bet.
  - question: I bought a course at X dollars and I'm thinking about getting this bundle. Do you offer discounts?
    answer: This pack already comes at an outrageous price, so it doesn't have additional discounts. "Discount" is its middle name, for crying out loud ðŸ˜„
